- Install git inside WSL if it's not already there
- Clone this git repo
- Copy the .env-example file to a new file: .env

### Log in to Twitch and set up MFA

- Log in to Twitch

  - Click on your profile icon in the top-right of the screen and click on Settings
  - Click Security and Privacy
  - Click Set Up Two-Factor Authentication
  - Click Enable 2FA and follow the instructions

### Create a Twitch Developer App
- Go to: [https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)  
- Click **Register Your Application**  
  - Name: *anything you like* (this must be globally unique)

  - Category: *Application Integration*
  - Client Type: *Confidential*

### Generate a Client Secret
- Click the `Manage` button on your new Application
- Click the `New Secret` button
- Copy and paste both the Client ID and the Client Secret into the relevant space in the `.env` file
- Run the following in a terminal to load these into your environment:
  ```
  set -a && source .env && set +a
  ```

---

### Get an Access Token (1-time setup)

Using the same terminal run:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://id.twitch.tv/oauth2/token' \
  -d "client_id=${TWITCH_CLIENT_ID}" \
  -d "client_secret=${TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET}" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials"
```

- Copy the **access token** and paste it in the relevant space in the `.env` file
- Load the variables in the file into your environment again:
  ```
  set -a && source .env && set +a
  ```

---

### Run it!

```bash
python twitch_api_vibecoding.py
```
